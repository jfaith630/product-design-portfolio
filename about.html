        <h4>Who am I?</h4>
        <p>To get the obilgatory philosophic crap out of the way, do any of us really know who we are? I’ll keep meditating on it, and maybe one day I can let you know... In the meantime, I can tell you that my name is James, I’m a mechanical engineer turned UX/UI designer & frontend developer, and I have lots of hobbies and interests!</p>
        <h5>I have a minor obsession with:</h5>
        <ul class="body-copy-list">
          <li><b>Rock/metal music & album artwork</b> - see my tshirt wall below</li>
          <li><b>Drums</b>  - I play in a rock band called Nonsense World Record (currently recording an EP)</li>
          <li><b>Classic video games</b> - A Link to the Past is the best Zelda, don’t try to change my mind.</li>
          <li><b>Tinkering with tech (often unnecessarily)</b> - I jailbroke my iPhone 5 when I was younger for no purpose other than to play with additional UI customization options.</li>
          <li><b>Yoga</b> - Namaste, bro.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>What sets me apart?</h4>
        <p>Having worked as an engineer for the past five years, I know the pressures of delivering a quality product to a client on time and within budget. I know the struggles of going back and reworking details that should have been figured out months ago. I know the need for clear and consistent communcation with teammates. I understand the importance of complex calculations, approval systems, and schedules. I’ve learned different types of coding & programming languages over the years, and have added frontend development to my repotoire... But I also know the importance of and highly value the design process.</p>
        <div class="heading-block"></div>
        <h4>Why is design important to me?</h4>
        <p>It’s not uncommon for Legos to have been the design inspiration for a young mind, but I can proudly say that these toys fueled my desire to design from a young age.</p>
        <p>There was always something I loved about utilizing “design units” such as lego pieces to create a full composition. In high school I took courses in fine art and tech design and loved them. I knew I enjoyed using tools and design systems to solve creative problems, and found I was good in math, so I ultimately pursued a career in mechanical engineering. (The same career path of my dad and his dad.)</p>
        <p>College was a big challenge for me because while I enjoyed courses such as calculus, computer science, and creative design, things like strength of materials and fluid dynamics didn’t necessarily do it for me. During this time, I worked a number of summer jobs in customer service. While these positions were certainly not glamorous and really just helped put money in my pocket, I gained a unique perspective on the importance of respect for users of a product or service. Beyond the old adage of “the customer is always right,” I learned a lot about empathizing with the customer and using simple psychological principles to achieve positive interactions. I learned that most people respond well to attention to detail and a thoughtful and considerate presence. This is something that can be provided through attentive design work.</p>
        <div class="quote">
          <div class="big-quotation-mark">"</div>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Design feels like a way of incorporating art into something that is actually usable and helpful to people.”</p>
          </blockquote>
        </div>
        <p>Of course, art alone can inspire life-changing emotional reactions, but design really provides for practical implementations that help solve real world problems. In my opinion, there will always be a need for design; and as technology advances, I don’t see this changing at all. Today’s smartphone screens will be tomorrow’s augmented reality displays. There will always be a need for design in order for humans to effectively communicate with other humans. I am passionate about using creative tools to make things easier for people, so design will always be at the forefront of my interests.</p>
