          <h4>Problem</h4>
          <p>The main focus of this project was designing desktop and mobile versions of a new cloud storage application coming to market. The client expressed that they would also need a name/brand, an idea of the target audience for the product, and a clear overall vision for the direction of the project.</p>

          <div class="heading-block"></div>
          <h4>Solution</h4>
          <p>Stratus is a cloud storage application that takes inspiration from other competing platforms, but stands out because of its appeal to the everyday user. By marketing Stratus as a tool that everyone can use, the brand is easily approachable. By making the platform’s visual style simple and clean, the brand keeps users coming back to it.</p>

          <h4>User Survey</h4>
          <p>I conducted user surveys on a diverse group of participants all with different professions and ages. In order to keep the results relevant, I included some screening questions pertaining to the users’ familiarity with technology in a general sense. Overall, participants were attracted to features such as simple user interfaces and available free storage.</p>
          <h5>Key takeaways</h5>
          <ul class="body-copy-list">
            <li>80% of participants said they organized their files using folders</li>
            <li>Only 35% organized using category/group tags</li>
            <li>100% of participants were interested in accessing their cloud storage from their mobile device, and also desired sharing/collaborating on files with other users</li>

        <!--COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS-->
        <div id="competitive-analysis" class="competitive-analysis">
          <div class="heading-block"></div>
          <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
          <p>I performed a competitive analysis on Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive. It was quickly clear that each of these applications did a great job of onboarding their potential users and providing an intuitive interface for uploading and managing files. All of the products go after everyday users of computers/file storage as their target audience. Because this is such a universal need, this isn’t hard to do.</p>
          <p>I reasoned that the main source of success for these products was seamless and intuitive integration into a users already-busy workflow. File management is something that practically all computer-users need to do, so utilizing an application that requires barely any setup and works incredibly well is really important. All of these apps do this well, and it differentiates them from the competition.</p>
          <h5>Competition Strengths</h5>
          <ul class="body-copy-list">
            <li>Clean, simple interface</li>
            <li>Collaborative features for teams</li>
            <li>Intuitive - Replicates “File Explorer” or “Finder”</li>
            </li>Right click menu available</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Competition Weaknesses</h5>
          <ul class="body-copy-list">
            <li>Right click menu available</li>
            <li>Moving an item to a folder takes longer than expected under certain circumstances</li>
            <li>Interface too busy with extra info</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="heading-block"></div>
          <h4>User Stories & Flows</h4>
          <p>I initially came up with a list of 35 user stories by picturing the actions different types of users would want to perform. In ranking these user stories in terms of importance, I considered which types of actions would be important to different users. For example the “Multiplatform” user would probably want to access their files on their mobile device much more than the “Backup Files” user. I ranked a total of 9 of these stories as highest priority based on what I expected to see in an MVP.</p>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th><b>Role:</b></th>
              <th><b>Task:</b></th>
            </tr>
            <tr>

              <td>I would like to create a new account.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>As a returning user</td>
              <td>I would like to sign in to my account.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>As a new/returning user</td>
              <td>I would like to upload a file/folder.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

            <tr>
              <td>As a new/returning user</td>
              <td>I would like for the changes I make to a document/folder structure online to be automatically saved.</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <p>In order to model my highest priority user stories in an executable form, I created a total of 5 user flows. Following are a few of them:</p>

          <h4>Wireframes</h4>
          <h5>Sketches</h5>
          <p>With all of the above preparations completed, it was finally time to start putting pen to paper and fleshing out the layout of the application. The “My Files” and other file management screens went through some iterations until I found a layout I thought best. To be specific, I thought a lot about how I wanted to represent the file management screen the user was currently working on (“My Files”, “Recent”, or “Trash”). My first idea shows a sidebar with the current screen underlined, but I ultimately decided on using more of a “tab” design.</p>

          <h5>Digital Wireframes</h5>
          <p>Using a Figma wireframing template, I was easily able to create digital wireframes based on these sketches. My overall aim was to keep things simple and clean, as simplicity is not only something that I deemed important to the UX, but also something that was important for the overall branding of the project.</p>

          <iframe width="500" height="320" src=""></iframe>
          <h5>Results</h5>
          <p>All users (including the less-experienced ones) were able to choose the correct menu option for uploading a file. This is important, because I feel this is the bare minimum functionality for the site. Users did however seem to have issues with the “Link File” terminology. This is something I updated in the final design. Most users said they would organize their files using folders. Nobody mentioned “tags” or “favorites”, so this validated not including this feature in my design and aligned with my survey results.</p>

          <h4>Branding</h4>
          <p>Instead of attempting to market this product toward a certain specific industry or demographic, I decided that it would be best to brand it as something any computer/internet user could (and should) utilize. Instead of highlighting that this was a large platform millions of people use, I thought the overall message should appeal to individual users who were looking for a “tool” to help them in their daily lives.</p>
          <p>I decided the name of the product would be Stratus. (Cirrus looked too much like the word circus for my liking.) A stratus cloud is a type of cloud that stays low in the atmosphere. Similarly, I wanted the product to be something that was “always close by” for the user. I wanted the brand to evoke feelings of calmness, stability, and harmony.</p>

          <h5>Moodboard</h5>
          <p>I created a moodboard to help understand how I wanted my assets/screens to be styled, and decided that the brand imagery should incorporate simple shapes and geometric designs. As you can see, I even went so far as using Windows 95 as inspiration... This explains the “sharpness” of windows in my final design. (Though this was a design risk to be sure, I think it certainly sets the design apart.)</p>

          <h5>Logo Design</h5>
          <p>I played with a number of ideas, but ultimately settled on a design that I feel is a bit different from other cloud storage logos while still being recognizable as an image related to a cloud. Of note is the fact that the “cloud” in the logo is flipped upside-down compared to other logo designs. The arrows pointing up and down are meant to represent the ability to deposit and retrieve files from the cloud service.</p>

          <h5>Color</h5>
          <p>The primary logo and branding colors I chose were Teal and Venice Blue as they evoke feelings of security, but also lightness.</p>

          <h5>Typography</h5>
          <p>The logo typeface I chose was Arial Rounded MT Bold because I believe it pairs well with the logo, and is light while still being bolded and strong. The complimentary main typography for the app is Rubik.</p>

          <h4>HighFi Mockups</h4>
          <p>With branding assets squared away, it was time to flesh out my wireframes into high fidelity mockups. Because I created my wireframes using a Figma template, playing around with different ideas was as easy as replacing blank boxes with content. Throughout this process, I contemplated a number of design variances. Some of the important design decisions I made are as follows.</p>
          <p>The mobile design borrowed a lot from the desktop version originally and didn’t conform to the Material Design Guidelines. The header and text entry fields were updated in the final design.</p>
          <p>In the desktop version of the application I changed the color and shape of the “highlight boxes” for the file management screen tabs. The original boxes were too similar to buttons used in other locations in the application and were confusing from a usability standpoint.</p>

          <h4>Preference Testing</h4>
          <p>The first preference test I conducted dealt with different “plan card” designs. Users liked the design with “fuller” colors. Another test compared the original mobile application with the version that conformed more to the Material Design guidelines. Users thought the Material Design Guidelines version looked more professional/updated. Fortunately, preference tests determined that the visual styling choices I made were indeed preferred by most.</p>

          <h5>Results</h5>
          <p>This second round of usability testing opened my eyes to a couple of important modifications in my design. Here are the major changes I made to the design based off of usability testing:</p>
          <ul class="body-copy-list">
            <li>To help ensure users that “drag & drop” functionality was available, I added a call to action on the file management screens of the desktop version of the app.</li>
            <li>There was a lot of confusion related to the “Get Link” menu option among users. I changed this text to “Share Link” to make the functionality of the option more clear.</li>
            <li>The file path text on the mobile app was both confusing and too “bulky” on the screen for most participants. I moved the file path text on the mobile app lower in the hierarchy of the screen as shown.</li>
            </li>I added a blurb on the homepage that more specifically stated what the purpose of the app/platform was in order to make things crystal clear for those unfamiliar with the technology.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>What I Learned</h4>
          <p>Sticking to my design process served me well in the implementation of this application. The project was an excellent experience in terms of honing my UX/UI design, visual design, and branding skills. Mistakes (such as initially not following the Material Design Guidelines for Android closely enough) were made, but I am proud of my final design! I successfully took criticisms from my mentor and (most importantly) users and translated them into actionable changes in the application. Following are some of my major takeaways.</p>
          <h5>Patience in visual design/branding process</h5>
          <p>“You can’t rush art!” - Old Guy in Toy Story 2. While this quote is true in many ways, we also live in a world of deadlines where things must get done. But the importance of being patient in creating a brand still stands. Items such as my logo for this project went through several iterations, and if I had just gone with the first idea I had, I don’t think the final product would have been as strong. It’s important to allow yourself to explore solutions from multiple angles as a designer.</p>
          <h5>Translating criticisms to actionable changes</h5>
          <p>It’s one thing to accept a criticism and move on, and another thing entirely to document it and incorporate it into the next iteration of a design. This project helped me become an expert in the latter.</p>
          <h5>Importance of the design process</h5>
          <p>The design process that I documented above was instrumental in bringing this whole project together. One step builds on another, and in most cases if you skip a step you’re going to have difficulty somewhere down the line. No matter the size/scale of the project, I know that mindfully following my design process will always serve me well in terms of deliverables and quality of work.</p>
